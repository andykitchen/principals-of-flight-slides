Eveything! Everything that can can ever think, everything that you will ever think
is encodable as bits, love, hate, compassion, intution, ethics, the smell of clean laundry!

- Church Turing Thesis
- 1. Bits 2. ... 3. Intelligence/Profit

- The best way way to predict the future is to invent it
- The best way to meet aliens is to build them

- The question of whether Machines Can Think... is about as relevant as the question of whether Submarines Can Swim. - "Edsger W. Dijkstra" 

- Turing Consistency
	- Enough parameters, Any computable function
	- Learn anything that can be learned

- Bayesian Stability
	- More data, Less surprise
	- Model Surprisal = System Entropy
	- Predict as much as can be predicted

- program search

- 10 bits per training example, 10 million bits of example

- 10^11 human neurons, 10^14 human synapses

- 10^8 simulated neurons, 10^9 synapses

- 10^14 synapses 10^9 seconds

- Deep Learning

- Structure Prior

- Parameter space

- Intelligent Region

- Patterns in Patterns

- Step towards regions of higher utility using data

- Models
	- ImageNet (Symmetry Prior)
	- DeepSpeech
	- DeepFace
	- Word2Vec
	- Go (Symmetry Prior)
	- OCR

- Many fused convex subspaces
